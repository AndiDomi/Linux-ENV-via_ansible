# Repo used for configuring a new linux system with Ansible (WIP)

##### Work in progress for auto configuring a dev-env in linux while learning Ansible 

###### Things to be learned a prior
- [ ] Research how to install this tools in ansible-pull
- [ ] Research ansible-galaxy 
> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaXVZ60o8L8]
> To have roles located localy we create a file name ansible.cfg and inside we paste this variable:
``` roles_path = ./roles ```
> where ./roles is the location of the folder that will hold these roles
> Also to have all the roles detailed in a single file we create a requirements.yml file which holds all the roles
> Example:
```
---
roles:
  - name: geerlingguy.homebrew
    version: 3.1.0
  - name: elliotweiser.osx-command-line-tools
    version: 2.3.0
```
> Then to install:
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```
